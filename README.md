# Field Color

A simple color field, it lets you store a 6-digit hex string in a bundle.
Included are two basic widgets and one formatter for CSS.

## Formatters

### Set value in CSS

This formatter lets you define a selector expression (that can use tokens),
if it should set the background or foreground color and wheter or not to add
!important.

## Widgets

### Enter hex value

This is just a text field, enter your hexadecimal color code or none to not
set a color.

### Pick color from a simple JS widget

This widget extends the text field slightly with a pop-up color widget and a
preview window. Click to select a hue and saturation.
